# Shell Providers (Shizuku & Root)

- Essentials supports both **Shizuku** and **Root** as shell providers for executing advanced system-level commands.
- **Shizuku**: Make sure to get the latest version of Shizuku preferably from a fork such as [yangFenTuoZi/Shizuku](https://github.com/yangFenTuoZi/Shizuku) or other not from the Google Play as it is no longer well supported especially with Android 16 QPR1 up.
- **Root**: If your device is rooted, Essentials can bypass Shizuku and use root privileges directly for features like Button Remap and App Freezing.
